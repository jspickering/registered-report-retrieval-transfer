2069372,I tried to create a wee song that had all of the animals/locations/objects to have something iterative to remember everything.,No,The song was my attempt but I don't think it was overly successful,Nope all good!,1

2069369,I tried to visualise the animals using the objects in exaggerated or silly ways (like an elephant wearing one shoe or a spider relaxing and eating a carrot). I also repeated the words aloud to engage more senses.,No I did this task alone.,"I only used my memory, visualisation and repeating the words out loud (almost making them into a song in the last stage).",It would be helpful to emphasis the two words in the set of three that are important to remember (whether they were in bold or something similar). I had no technical issues.,1
2069537,Trying to picture them together,Trying to say the words in my head together to form one thing,No,NA,1
2069522,Visualize and try to combine the words like picturing an ice cream waterfall for example,No.,"No, just tried to visualize.",I'd lengthen the answering time by 5 seconds or so. There were times I was typing and didn't hit enter before the time so it didnt log my answer,1
2070024,Just tried to picture a scenario including all 3. Also tried to use some dialogue for the scenario ie for fox hospital keys I thought of a fox locking a hospital door telling his fox mate he's locking up for the night (lol),No,No,No,1

2075962,Linking to realistic scenarios or stories I've read,no,no,I am dyslexic so slow reader and processing. Slow working memory,1
2075946,tried to picture the animal in the location holding/using the object,no,repeating the words out loud,NA,1
2075956,I tried to remember a scenario like the task said to try to memorize the pairs,No one else helped me,No I only tried to memorize the scenario,"The timer to answer and the 3 sec warning was a little short, as many times I panicked and wrote the wrong pair or missed to enter the word by 1 sec.",1
2075953,A mini-story about something an animal would do with the object and in the location.,No,No,None,1
2075950,I tried to make a story and put all of them together,"No, I did it alone.",No.,"No, everything was fine.",1
2075959,"Tried to imagine all three combined but still, a lot information, pretty nice survey and challenging, a lot!!","no, just by my self.",no.,"Like I said, just think it were to many, I find my self with good memory but that was hard",1
2075952,i tried to picture them using the objects for something do with the location for example a pig needed glasses to read the timetable at the railway station.,no,no,no,1

2080734,I tried to come up with a scene where the animal was using the object at the location.,No,no,No,1
2080727,"I pictured the objects interacting. If the interaction was violent, upsetting, or negative in some way that made it easier to remember.",No one helped.,"No, I only looked at the screen and tried my best to picture it, as instructed. I don't get paid more for remembering it better, lol.","No technical issues. Months ago, I did a memory test on Prolific that was a little bit similar (not exactly the same) and tested so well the researcher thought I had cheated (by taking video or something, which I did not) but believed me that I didn't when we discussed it. I've been weirdly proud of that since then. I'm sure I'll forget a lot in four days, but curious to see how the old noggin does this time!",1
2080725,I always tried to visualize everything I could remember so I would more closely associate the words.,No one.,Nothing at all.,Nothing at all.,1
2080722,I just tried my best to imagine the vivid mental image as the instructions suggested (eg. lobster holding screwdriver in factory),No,No other strategies,"During the second part of the task, I sometimes (due to pressure) make a mistake and type in the location instead of the animal. I think if you can make it more obvious whether the task wants us to type in the animal or location, that would help. (Eg. Have a colour scheme like if asking for ANIMAL, display the typing box as red, if asking for LOCATION, display the typing box green - just to remind me)",1

2083601,"I don't know if you hip researchers watch Bojack Horseman, but I tried to imagine the animals as characters in that show within their contexts, interacting with their objects. Eg. The dolphin is dressed like Juliet, she's on a balcony and she drops a wallet",NA,"No but now I'm terrified I've destoyed my short term memory with veganism. I guess if that's the case, let me know?","No technical issues, other than sometimes when in the recall section it changed from object to animal or setting, it became confusing and stressful with the time limit to switch to a different part of the memory - lead to a few mistakes",1
2083602,"repeating pairs in my mind, devleoping mental images",no,no,no,1
2083615,"I just tried to imagine the animals doing something at that location with the objects. Most of the time I could only really find a good connection between 2 out of the 3. For instance, I remembered the frog sitting on a banana but I can't remember where it was. I remember a banana on the floor at the location wouldn't make sense so it was hard to remember. Monkeys/ring/living room was easy because I just thought of humans (monkeys) proposing in a livingroom which can make sense.",No,No,No,1

2083605,"I pictured the scenario, usually they are funny and work such as. Crocodile wearing a HAT and waitnig at the Busstop or PANDA rollypolly with LAMP in his hand in a CAFE, FROG eating BANANA as he leaps in the CITY",no,no,I think I memorized the first half of the tripplets much better than the rest and was lucky that most of the questions were from that batch. As the number of the pairs increased it became very difficult and annoying to memorize them and it was too much effort. I think a little more time to memorize would have helped more specially if trying to picture somthing that I can remember.,1

For example- the crab used a calculator at the museum,No,Said the words outloud,"Only having 10 seconds kinda of made me panic that i wouldnt be able to type an answer fast enough. I think I would've done better had it been 15-20 seconds. Also, when seeing just one word I had trouble remembering what 2 words went with it, but when i saw the 2 words it was alot easier for me to remember what the 3rd word of the group was.",1

2104757,I came up with the mental image,It was easy to remember if I could picture the animal with the item,Some of the memory recall was hard because some places had similar names. Badger at gym or Beaver at the pharmacy.,"Some of them I just couldn't come up with a mental image so it didn't stick. I could list a bunch that I do have an image for. mouse beach television, giraffe mountain clock, pig glasses trainstation, fish dice theater, sheep / goat jump roap church, horse phone kitchen, and maybe more if I had more time to answer. Very neat exercise.",1
